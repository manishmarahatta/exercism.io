# Roadmap

## Overview

Development efforts at the moment focus on making the core experience good: 

* smooth onboarding, 
- rich conversations, 
- high quality feedback, and 
- getting feedback quickly.

### Smooth Onboarding

From quickly/concisely conveying what a programmer (of various stripes) would get from participating in Exercism, to the actual path from zero to submitted exercise on any given track, it can be bumpy.

Let's hunt down bits of waste particularly along this path and flatten them: extraneous words and confusing flows should be substituted for clear instructions and intuitive/guided next steps.

The root of these efforts focus on User Experience (UX).  The following are jumping-off points into those efforts.

* call for help with UX in general: [exercism/discussions#34](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/34).
- conveying value and clear action on the homepage: [exercism/discussions#31](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/31).

### Rich Conversations

Exercism is fundamentally a space that encourages programmers to talk about what's going on in their heads as they work and rework their code.  That thinking bit is the heart of how individuals can become better.

What can we do to encourage more and richer conversations among Exercism users?
