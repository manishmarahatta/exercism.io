# Triaging Issues in an Exercism Language Track

Issues need to be unambiguous and actionable. If it's hard to figure out what
an issue is about, or what needs to be done, then the issue probably won't get
fixed.

## Making Issues Great

The goal of triaging issues is to make sure that each issue is actionable.

A great issue also has enough context that it could be tackled by someone who has never contributed
to Exercism before.

When reading an issue you should be able to answer questions like...

* What is the problem?
* Why is this a problem?
* Who might run into it? Everyone? Or is it an edge case?
* What needs to be done? How will we know that the issue can be closed?
  Is there something we need to figure out or decide before it can be fixed?
* Where in the code will the fix go? This might be obvious, but it might not be. If we can point
  to the right directory or file, that helps.

If the issue isn't great yet, then the best help you can provide is to ask clarifying questions to help
make it great.

## Still Relevant?

Along the way you might run into issues that have already been resolved (we just forgot to close it), or
that just aren't relevant any more, because the world has moved on.

If you see one of these, then add a comment suggesting that we close it, with a note about why it can be
closed.
